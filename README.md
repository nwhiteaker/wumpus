# wumpus
My console-based version of Hunt the Wumpus, still missing a lot of features. Probably only works on Linux and xterm too, not very portable.

#### Features yet to be implemented
- Shooting the Wumpus/Bats
- Some kind of way to actually win the game
- Some kind of way to restart/regenerate the game once you win/lose
- Sound (more hacky linux-only code to use the PC speaker?)
- Bigger/smaller mazes
- Possibly new enemies/hazards that deviate from the original
